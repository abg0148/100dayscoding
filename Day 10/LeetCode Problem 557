Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Example 1:
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        int start = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();++i){
            if(s[i] == ' '){
                reverse(s.begin()+start, s.begin()+i);
                start = i+1;
            }
        }
        reverse(s.begin()+start, s.end());
        
        return s;
    }
};
