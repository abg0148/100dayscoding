Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word (last word means the last appearing word if we loop from left to right) in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example:

Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5


/*
Solved by traversing the string from the end and if space is not found increment the count and when whitespace is found return the count
*/



class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = s.length()-1;i>=0;i--){
            if(s.at(i) != ' ')
                count++;
            else
                if(count>0)
                    return count;
        }
            return count;
    }
};
