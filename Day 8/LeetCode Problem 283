Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Note:

You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.


/*
Solved using the two pointer approach i.e. if value at the pointer is 0 then swap it with the other pointer value

class Solution {
public:
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int last = 0, curr = 0;
        while(curr<nums.size()){
            if(nums[curr] != 0){
                swap(nums[last], nums[curr]);
                last++;
            }
            curr++;
        }
    }
};
