Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
 

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 10^3
-10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3
-10^4 <= target <= 10^4


// Solved using Two Pointer Technique and returning the sum closest to the target



class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
      int diff = INT_MAX;
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size() and diff !=0;++i){
            int left = i+1, right = nums.size()-1;
            while(left<right){
                int sum = nums[i]+nums[left]+nums[right];
                if(abs(target-sum) < abs(diff))
                    diff = target - sum;
                if(sum < target)
                    ++left;
                else
                    --right;
            }
        }
        return target-diff;
    }
};
