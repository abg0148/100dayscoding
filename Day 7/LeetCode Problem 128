Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.


/*
Solved by using the approach that firstly sort the array and then check the condition that ith is equal to (i-1)th + 1
*/



class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() == 0)
            return 0;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int count = 1;
        int largestCount = 1;
        for(int i=1;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i] != nums[i-1]){
                if(nums[i] == nums[i-1]+1){
                    count += 1;
                }
                else{
                    largestCount = max(largestCount, count);
                    count = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return max(largestCount, count);
    }
};
